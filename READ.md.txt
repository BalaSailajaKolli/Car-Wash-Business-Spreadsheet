# ðŸš—ðŸ’¡ From Casual Chat to Business Clarity: How We Built a Smart Spreadsheet for a Car Wash Startup ðŸ“šâœ¨

## Overview
This project started with a casual conversation with a friend who owns a car wash business (City Car Wash).  
He wanted a simple way to manage his money, track expenses, and understand his daily financial health without manual calculations.

## Project Motivation
- Helped a friend track finances easily without expensive software.
- Built a smart spreadsheet system to simplify and automate financial tracking.
- Made it easy to view profits, losses, and pending payments at a glance.

## Key Requirements
- Track number of cars and bikes serviced daily.
- Maintain records of payrolls, store expenses, and personal payouts separately.
- Clearly distinguish UPI transactions from cash handling.
- Monitor daily and cumulative profits/losses.
- Generate a monthly financial summary automatically.

## Solution Highlights
- **Daily Transaction Tracker** with fields for:
  - Number of vehicles
  - Charges collected
  - Revenue generated
  - Different expense categories
  
- **Automation**:
  - Total In and Total Out are auto-calculated for each day.
  - Running total of daily profit/loss is maintained from Day 2 onwards.
  - Seamless month-wise connection across sheets.

- **Conditional Formatting**:
  - Profits are highlighted in green.
  - Losses are highlighted in red for quick insights.

- **Smart Formulas Used**:
  - `SUM`, `DIFFERENCE`, `MULTIPLY`, `INDIRECT`, `VLOOKUP`, and `ARRAYFORMULA` automate all calculations.
  
- **Monthly Summary Sheet**:
  - Auto-collects data from all daily sheets.
  - Displays Total Revenue, Total Expenses, and Final Net Profit/Loss for the month.
  - Helps quickly assess overall monthly performance.

- **Visualization**:
  - Bar charts and pie charts created for:
    - Earnings
    - Expenses
    - Net Profit comparison

- **Separate Tracking**:
